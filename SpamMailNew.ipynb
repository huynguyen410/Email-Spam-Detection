    "1. **Initialization**: A `RandomForestClassifier` is initialized using the `sklearn` library with default hyperparameters to ensure simplicity and reproducibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Training**: The model is trained on the resampled training dataset (`X_train_resampled`, `Y_train_resampled`) to account for class imbalance. The training process involves fitting the Random Forest model on the features and labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Evaluation**: Predictions are made on both the training and test datasets to evaluate the model's accuracy. Key metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score are calculated, and a confusion matrix is generated to visualize the classification results.\n"
